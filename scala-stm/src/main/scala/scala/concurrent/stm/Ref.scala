/** Provides access to a single element of type ''A''.  Accesses are
 *  performed as part of a ''memory transaction'' that comprises all of the
 *  operations of an atomic block and any nested blocks.  Single-operation
 *  memory transactions may be performed without an explicit atomic block using
 *  the `Ref.View` returned from `single`.  The software transactional memory
 *  performs concurrency control to make sure that all committed transactions
 *  are linearizable.  Reads and writes performed by a successful transaction
 *  return the same values as if they were executed instantaneously at the
 *  transaction's commit (linearization) point.
 *
 *  The static scope of an atomic block is defined by access to an implicit
 *  `InTxn` passed to the block by the STM.  Atomic blocks nest, so to
 *  participate in an atomic block for which a `InTxn` is not conveniently
 *  available, just create a new atomic block using {{{
 *    atomic { implicit t =>
 *      // the body
 *    }
 *  }}}
 *  In the static scope of an atomic block reads and writes of a `Ref`
 *  are performed by `x.get` and `x.set(v)`, or more concisely by `x()` and
 *  `x() = v`. `x.single` returns a `Ref.View` that will dynamically resolve
 *  the current scope during each method call, automatically creating a
 *  single-operation atomic block if no transaction is active.
 *
 *  It is possible for separate `Ref` instances to refer to the same element;
 *  in this case they will compare equal.  (As an example, a transactional
 *  array class might store elements in an array and create `Ref`s on demand.)
 *  `Ref`s may be provided for computed values, such as the emptiness of a
 *  queue, to allow  conditional retry and waiting on semantic properties.
 *
 *  To perform an access outside a transaction, use the view returned by
 *  `single`.  Each access through the returned view will act as if it was
 *  performed in its own single-operation transaction, dynamically nesting into
 *  an active atomic block as appropriate.
 *
 *  `Ref`'s companion object contains factory methods that create `Ref`
 *  instances paired with a single STM-managed memory location.

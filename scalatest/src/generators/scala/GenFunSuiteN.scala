/**
$if (moreThanOne)$
 * A suite of tests in which each test is represented as a function value that takes $num$ parameters that
 * are intended to serve as fixture objects for the suite's tests. Clients must parameterize <code>FunSuite$num$</code> with the types of each 
 * of the fixture objects. Most often this will be done explicitly by subclasses that have tests that need the fixture objects. Here's an example:
$else$
 * A suite of tests in which each test is represented as a function value that takes 1 parameter that
 * is intended to serve as a fixture object for the suite's tests. Clients must parameterize <code>FunSuite1</code> with the type of the
 * fixture object. Most often this will be done explicitly by subclasses that have tests that need the fixture object. Here's an example:
$endif$
 <pre>
 * class MySuite extends FunSuite$num$[$exampleParams$] {
 *
 *   testWithFixture("example test") {
 *     ($exampleArgs$) => {
 *       // test code that uses the passed fixture object$if (moreThanOne)$s$endif$...
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   def withFixture(f: ($exampleParams$) => Unit) {
 *
 *      // Create the fixture objects (as in JUnit 3's setUp method)
 *      $argDefinitions$
 *
 *      // Pass the fixture objects to the test function
 *      f($exampleArgs$)
 *
 *      // If need be, perform any cleanup (as in JUnit 3's tearDown method)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is a contrived example, because normally you would only pass fixture objects in this manner if
 * they are mutable. (The reason we used immutable objects in this example was just to make the type names fit
 * more easily on the page.) If they aren't mutable, then the fixture objects can simply be referenced from instance
 * variables and shared by all test methods that need them. Since they aren't mutable, they can't be "corrupted"
 * by one test and rendered unusable by the next. For mutable fixture objects, though, this trait allows you
 * to reinitialize and pass in a fresh set of fixture objects to each test function that needs them.
